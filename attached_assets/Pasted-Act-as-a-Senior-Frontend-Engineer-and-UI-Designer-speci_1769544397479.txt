Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer and UI Designer specializing in modern, high-end interfaces. Build a single-page personal holding company website called "Stillfrost".

### THE AESTHETIC: "Ethereal Glassmorphism"
The vibe must be light, airy, futuristic, and premium.
Think: Apple visionOS interface, frozen vapor, clean laboratory.

**Crucial Design Elements:**
1.  **Background:** NOT solid white. It needs a very subtle, soft gradient background to allow the glass cards to stand out. Use a linear gradient from top-left to bottom-right, fading from a very pale icy blue to faint white (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-br from-sky-50 via-white to-indigo-50`).
2.  **The "Frosted Glass" Cards:**
    -   **Background:** High transparency white (`bg-white/40` to `bg-white/60`).
    -   **Blur:** Heavy frosted effect (`backdrop-blur-xl` or `2xl`).
    -   **Border:** A crisp, thin, semi-transparent white border to define edges (`border border-white/50`).
    -   **Shadow:** A very soft, diffuse shadow colored with light blue to lift it off the page (`shadow-xl shadow-sky-200/30`).
    -   **Interaction:** Subtle hover lift (`hover:-translate-y-1`) and a slightly brighter border.

### TECH STACK
- Framework: React (Vite)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (essential for utility-first glassmorphism)
- Animation: Framer Motion (for smooth, ethereal entrances)
- Icons: Lucide React (use thin stroke icons)
- Fonts: Use Google Fonts.
  - Headings: 'Playfair Display' (Serif) - conveys institutional weight.
  - Body/UI: 'Geist Mono' or 'JetBrains Mono' (Monospace) - conveys technical precision.

### COLOR PALETTE
- **Text Primary:** Deep Slate Blue/Charcoal (e.g., `text-slate-800`). DO NOT use pure black, it's too harsh against the light glass.
- **Text Secondary:** Muted Blue-Grey (e.g., `text-slate-500`).
- **Accents:** Clear Sky Blue (e.g., `text-sky-600`) for links or highlights.

### LAYOUT STRUCTURE (Single Page Bento Grid)

**1. HERO SECTION (Centered, Minimal)**
- **Logo:** "STILLFROST" (Playfair Display, Tracking-widest, Uppercase, text-4xl, color: deep slate).
- **Subtitle:** "Private Product Incubation & Capital Deployment" (Monospace, text-sm, muted blue-grey).
- **Status Widget:** A glass pill containing a pulsing icy-blue dot and the text "Systems Operational".

**2. THE BENTO GRID (The Core Content)**
Create a responsive CSS Grid (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop). Apply the "Frosted Glass Card" styling defined above to these containers.

- **CARD 1 (Left Column - The Investor): Strategic Capital**
  - *Icon:* A thin line chart or network icon (Lucide).
  - *Title:* "Ai16z / ElizaOS Ecosystem"
  - *Badge:* A small glass pill showing "Strategic Partner".
  - *Description:* "Deployed early high-conviction capital ($2.3M+ peak position) into the ElizaOS multi-agent ecosystem. Consulting on tokenomic risk models and governance."

- **CARD 2 (Right Column - The Builder): Incubation Labs**
  - *Icon:* A terminal or CPU icon.
  - *Title:* "AssetHunter.io"
  - *Badge:* A small glass pill showing "Proprietary Tech".
  - *Description:* "Python-based deal origination engine using Multi-Agent AI Systems to identify distressed software assets. Architected purely in-house."

- **CARD 3 & 4 (Bottom Row - Smaller Cards):**
  - *Card 3:* Title: "Wrist Reads". Desc: "Standalone WatchOS application. Minimalist UX experiment."
  - *Card 4 (Tech Stack):* A collection of small glass badges: [Python] [React] [Tailwind] [Smart Contracts] [Multi-Agent AI].

**3. FOOTER**
- Simple, clean text in the muted color: "Toronto, ON | © 2025 Stillfrost."
- Links: LinkedIn, GitHub.

### EXECUTION
Set up the project, install dependencies (framer-motion, lucide-react), and generate the complete App.jsx and index.css. Ensure the Tailwind config is set up to handle backdrop-filters by default.
