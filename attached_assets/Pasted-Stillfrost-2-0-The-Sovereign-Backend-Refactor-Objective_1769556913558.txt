Stillfrost 2.0: The Sovereign Backend Refactor
Objective: Refactor the Python backend into a Self-Correcting, Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (MAS) using CrewAI and LangGraph.

1. Hierarchical Control Layer (The Governor):

Implement Stillfrost Oversight as the Process Manager using Process.hierarchical logic.

Governance Protocol: Configure Oversight to use the 80/20 Rule for task triage and Regret Minimization for project selection.

Oversight must approve all outputs from the worker agents before they are finalized or visible in the dashboard.

2. Worker Agent Definitions (The DNA):

Stillfrost Intelligence: Role is Market Arbitrage. Scans for "Secrets" (distressed software or unoptimized workflows) in Finance, Tech, and Real Estate. Never segments by "Industry," only by "Distribution Platform".

Stillfrost Logic: Role is the Absolute Zero Filter. Performs 1st-principles audits and enforces The Stillfrost Standard. It must reject any output that feels "scalable" or "digital-only".

Stillfrost Systems: Role is Technical Incubation. Manages the codebases of staff-less assets (e.g., Wrist Reads, AssetHunter) and ensures 99.98% uptime.

Stillfrost Reach: Role is High-Status Distribution. Executes the Advice Trap Strategy, seeking "Advice on an MVP" from central "Nodes" rather than selling.

3. The Stillfrost Standard Audit Function:

Implement an enforce_standard() method in Python. This function must use an LLM-evaluator to scan for "Rubbish" keywords: scalable, digital, automated, template, bulk.

Friction Check: The audit fails unless the output contains a High-Friction Signal (e.g., custom video audit, physical gift procurement, or deep-dive product critique).

4. Self-Correcting Feedback Loop:

Use replit.db to store a post_mortem_log. If Stillfrost Reach fails to get a response from a "Node," Stillfrost Logic must audit the failure and provide feedback to Stillfrost Intelligence to pivot the strategy.

5. Real-Time Telemetry & Sync:

Stream agent "thoughts," task states, and "Post-Mortem" reflections via WebSocket to the /dashboard Live Feed.

Update the "Active Ventures" card automatically when Stillfrost Systems detects a new deployment or status change.
